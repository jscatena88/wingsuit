# Wingsuit
A pygame based game where you play as a wingsuit wearing skydiver avoiding cave walls above and below. The walls are generated dynamically but get closer together the deeper you go. Play is reminiscent of FlappyBird and other similar games, simple physics and controlls, last as long as you can.

## Installation
Install Python and pygame, then run main.py

## Contributing
This project was originally made at a hackathon and at this point is also quite old. This would be an ideal project to do your first open source contributions on. The main authors are no longer actively developing the project but would be happy to review and accept meaningful improvments.

### Contribution suggestions
- Upgrade to Python 3
- Improve graphics
- Improve menus
- Add audio
- Whatever else you can think of ( if we like it we'll accept it, if you are unsure if youre idea will be accepted feel free to contact us before working on it)
